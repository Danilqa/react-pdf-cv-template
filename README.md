## Motivation

1. Many online templates and services look beautiful but aren't functional enough. They have too many unnecessary 
things like avatar, skill scores, and company logos. This takes up too much space, so it's hard to fit all the important information on one page. Also, these kinds of resumes are often not easy for computer programs to read.
2. With other services, you can't keep track of changes, and you have to enter all your information through forms.
3. You can't change layout easily, and if you need to make changes later, you often have to use complicated
tools like LaTeX.

## Structure

1. `src/cv-document.tsx` - main file for your CV. You can fill your data here.
2. `src/elements` - folder with atomic elements for your CV: bullet, list, bold, etc.
3. `src/sections` - folder with complex sections for your CV: header and experience.
